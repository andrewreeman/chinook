# Chinook README

This project is a playground for illustrating technology concepts such as:

* Architecture and Design
* API Design
* Docker
* .NET 5 For all backend
* React (Typescript) For all frontend
* Database Migrations and Versioning

The name of this project was chosen based on a fictitious media store called '**_chinook_**'.

## 1. Design

This section describes the general design and architecture of the _Chinook_ system.

### High Level Architecture

The overall system design has the traits of a [Modular Monolith]. The system is composed of 3 primary sub-systems (modules) namely:

* Catalog - Music catalog management
* Operations - Employee management
* Sales - Sales and customer management

There is a single database comprised of 3 schemas that closely relate to the aforementioned modules.

The following 2 diagrams illustrate 2 potential architectural approaches. The big difference between the 2 different approaches is with regards to the API layer. 

#### High Level View 1

For the first approach, there is a single API that interfaces into all 3 Chinook modules.

#### High Level View 2

For the second approach, there is a single API per module.

### Module Architecture

Each sub-system (module) high-level architecture has been influenced by the following architectural ideas:

* [Layered Architecture]
* [Hexagonal Architecture]
* [Onion Architecture]
* [Clean Architecture]
* [Modular Monolith]

#### High Level View

As can be seen by the diagram below, the arrows are always pointing inwards (or down) from one layer to the next. The whole idea is to ensure that dependants that change the least are at the center, with dependants that change the most at the top (outer) most level.

**Domain and Domain Services**
  
_Primary Responsibility: Enterprise domain logic_

All domain logic relating to domain models and domain services are handled in this layer.

**Application**

_Primary Responsibility: Application logic_

This layer is typically where you would find "Application "Services" and "Use Cases". However, the CQRS design pattern is being used in place of "Use Cases" and "Application Services".

**Infrastructure**

_Primary Responsibility: Provide the core of the system an interface to the "world"_

This layer is aall about defining and configuring external dependencies such as:

* database access
* proxies to other API's
* logging
* monitoring
* dependency injection

**API**

_Primary Responsibility: Provides a distributed interface that gives access to application features_

All API's in this project have been implemented as _HTTP_ services with a strong REST influence. I've chosen not to call the API's "REST API's" due to using the _"[Richardson Maturity Model]"_ as a guide. Currently, in terms of the _"[Richardson Maturity Model]"_, all API's in this project only support up to and including Level 2. The next level up is to support HATEOAS and will be added to the product roadmap.

## 2. Technology Used

### OS

I have developed and tested _Chinook_ on the following Operating Systems.

* [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS]

  Ubuntu is an open source software operating system that runs from the desktop, to the cloud, to all your internet connected things.

* Windows 10 Professional

  In addition to developing _Chinook_ on Windows 10, I have also tried and tested _Chinook_ using [Windows Subsystem For Linux]. Specifically, I have used [WSL-Ubuntu]. See more about [WSL] below.

  * [Windows Subsystem For Linux]

    The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a virtual machine.

  * [Windows Subsystem For Linux 2]
  
    NOTE: I have not tested _Chinook_ on [WSL2] yet. I mention it here because I want to be clear that I've only tested on [WSL] (not to be confused with WSL2).

    WSL 2 is a new version of the architecture in WSL that changes how Linux distros interact with Windows. WSL 2 has the primary goals of increasing file system performance and adding full system call compatibility. Each Linux distro can run as a WSL 1, or a WSL 2 distro and can be switched between at any time. WSL 2 is a major overhaul of the underlying architecture and uses virtualization technology and a Linux kernel to enable its new features.

### Code

* [Visual Studio Code]

  Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

* [Visual Studio Community Edition]

  A fully-featured, extensible, **FREE** IDE for creating modern applications for Android, iOS, Windows, as well as web applications and cloud services.

### Database

* [Postgresql]

  PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance. It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many concurrent users.

* [pgAdmin4]

  Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL

* [Flyway]

  Flyway is an open source database migration tool.

### Docker

* [Docker]

  Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization. It is developed by Docker, Inc.

* [Docker-Compose]

  Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

## 3. Getting Started

Before getting started, the following frameworks must be installed on your machine:

* Docker
* Docker-Compose
* .NET 5
* Node 12

### Get The Code

Clone 'chinook' repository from GitHub

```bash
# using https
git clone https://github.com/drminnaar/chinook.git

# or using ssh
git clone git@github.com:drminnaar/chinook.git
```

### Database Setup

The primary database that will be used is a Postgres database based on the '**_chinook_**' Sql database. The initial inspiration was taken from the [cwoodruff/ChinookDatabase
](https://github.com/cwoodruff/ChinookDatabase) github repository. For this project, the original [chinook database script] has been decomposed into different versioned migrations that will be used by the [Flyway] database version and migration tool.

#### Create And Run Database

A [Docker] container is used to host a [Postgresql] database. Furthermore, a [Docker-Compose] file has been included that can be used to more conveniently startup a [Postgresql] database. For further convenience, a database refresh script has been included for _bash_ and _powershell_. The script files can be used to spin up a database environment using postgres with all the database migrations executed using [Flyway].

__For Linux using Bash:__

```bash
# only run once to give script execute permissions
chmod +x ./refresh-chinook-db.sh

# create chinook database and populate with data
./refresh-chinook-db.sh
```

__For any OS running Powershell:__

```bash
# create chinook database and populate with data
./refresh-chinook-db.ps1
```

Once the script completes successfully, you should see an output in your console that resembles something that looks like the following:

```diff
Script started! Creating new chinook database using Docker, Docker-Compose, and Postgres.

  - username: postgres
  - password: password
```

### Get Node Ready

NPM is being used as a task runner of sorts. It's the reason for having a dependency on Node and NPM. Although the _dotnet CLI_ is fantastic, I wanted to illustrate how one might combine the 2. Therefore, if you have a look at the root of the solution, you will notice a packages.json file that has a number of tasks setup. It also have the "concurrently" package installed to run tasks in parallel.

For example:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "dotnet build ./src",
    "catalog": "dotnet watch --project ./src/Catalog/Chinook.Catalog.Api run",
    "operations": "dotnet watch --project ./src/Operations/Chinook.Operations.Api run",
    "sales": "dotnet watch --project ./src/Sales/Chinook.Sales.Api run",
    "start": "concurrently \"npm run catalog\" \"npm run operations\" \"npm run sales\""
}
```

From the command line, type the following:

```bash
# change to project root
cd ./chinook

# install node_modules
npm install
```

### Build The Code

```bash
# change to project root
cd ./chinook

# build solution
npm run build
```

### Running the Api's

Each Api can be run from a _Solution file_, or via the command line at the Api path. However, for convenience, one can run any of the Api's using _npm_ as follows:

```bash
# change to project root
cd ./chinook

# To run 'Catalog Api' (http://localhost:5000)
npm run catalog

# To run 'Operations Api' (http://localhost:5001)
npm run operations

# To run 'Sales Api' (http://localhost:5002)
npm run sales

# To run all Api's
npm start
```
